These are the documentation sources for command tool
for extracting data from HTML pages.

See `<http://scrape.readthedocs.org>`_ for the documentation.

.. notes to self -
   govt site regularly scraped - thomas.loc.gov
   see also - programmableweb.com (I think this is a nyt site)


.. CC License use examples:
   http://ocw.mit.edu/terms/index.htm

.. Notes:
   This open courseware site posts the "human" version,
   with a link to the CC version on the CC site;
   The use of MIT Name clause, and the MIT Interpretations
   of "Non-Commercial" clause seem to complicate this more
   than I would care to deal with at this time.
