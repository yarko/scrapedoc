=========================
|Shdr| - the Documentation
=========================



|SP| is a tool developed to help researchers extract
selective data from web publications.
It is particularly useful for serial web publications
which have similar structure over many issues.
You interactively develop a selection and extraction
set of commands, and run them across a series of
issues, generating output (JSON or CSV).

You can also look through the *notable tools* section on
`Wikipedia <http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping>`_.

Many of these are either not interactive,
or are programmers libraries or toolkits.
|S| is an interactive script development tool
which, with a modicum of knowledge, is both powerful and simple.
|S| scripts use |s| commands, shell commands, and commands
provided by extensions.
